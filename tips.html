                        <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                        <p>he ideal time to explore the natural wonders of the Philippines is during the dry season, which runs from November to April. During these 
                            months, you can expect sunny skies and minimal rainfall, making it perfect for outdoor adventures, beach outings, and island hopping. 
                            While the dry season is popular among tourists, visiting during the shoulder months (May and October) can also offer pleasant weather 
                            with fewer crowds.</p>
